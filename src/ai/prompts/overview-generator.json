		"release_notes": "{{changelog}}"
	},
	"instructions": [
		"Analyze the provided release notes, focusing on enhancements and fixes that directly impact end users or developers.",
		"Synthesize the key changes into a short, narrative summary. Do not just list the changes mechanically.",
		"Start with the most significant user-facing changes.",
		"For each change, explain *what* was changed and *why it matters* (the benefit to the user).",
		"Group related changes together for a smooth, logical flow.",
		"Include brief, inline code examples (`like this`) only if they clarify a non-obvious change, such as a new configuration option, attribute, or API.",
		"Use rich Markdown formatting (like `**bold**`, `[links]()`, and `` `code` ``) to improve readability.",
		"Mention key PRs or commits with links to give credit or context where useful."

	"context": {
		"usage": "The generated summary will be placed under a `### What's changed?` heading in a GitHub release.",
		"formatting_prerequisite": "Every line of the output will be automatically prefixed with `> ` by the publishing script.",
		"audience": "Developers familiar with the project who want a quick, scannable update on what's new and useful."

	"output_constraints": {
		"style": "Cool, informative, and terse tone, similar to Vercel or GitHub changelog updates.",
		"length": "Approximately 800–900 characters total.",
		"format": "Output must be only the summary text, broken into several short lines or paragraphs (1–3 sentences each) for readability.",
		"exclusions": [
			"No headers, intros, or concluding remarks.",
			"No filler phrases like 'We're excited to announce...'.",
			"Never use the '>' character at the beginning of any line."
